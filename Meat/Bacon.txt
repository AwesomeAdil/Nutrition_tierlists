- C Tier
- Pork
- Can vary from manufacturer to manufacturer
- Bacon is dehydrated: More nutritionally dense per gram
- High in Oleic Acid : Shown to Lower LDL Levels, improve insulin sensitivity reduce inflamation and improve Sensorimotor function
- Great source of Selenium: Acts as Antioxidant - Protects cells and DNA formation
- Good Source of Phosphorus: Growth, Cell Maintenance, and DNA production
> Note that has high saturated fat: in the past people associated SF with higher LDL and heart disease, but it may be due to the length of the
  carbon chain that plays a bigger role (longer carbon chains inverts LDL raising effects => longer carbon chain better)
    - Palamic Acid (SF-16)[~8400mg]: Raises concentration of larger LDL particles, adversely affects mood and energy levels
    - Stearic Acid (SF-18)[~4200mg]: Neutral effect on LDL
    - Mystristic Acid (SF-14)[~500mg]: Stronger Effect on raising LDL
- High in Sodium: Increased risk of cancer and high BP in excess.
- Often Contains Additives like Nitrates & Nitrites - shown to, under high heat cooking, forms Nitrosamines 
  (A known carcinogen). Vitamin C could be added to some what reduce effects.
